<h2>My Opinion</h2>
<p>In my opinion large donations and lobbyists have a negative effect on American politicians. I believe this because a politician is going to favor their largest donors opinion over the opinion of the people they represent. In a representative democracy it is extremely important that elected officials represent the majority of the population that they represent not a affluent few or large corporation.</p>
